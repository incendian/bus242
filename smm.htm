			"Super Mario Maker is a side-scrolling platform video game and game creation system developed and published by Nintendo for the Wii U game console, and released worldwide in September 2015. Players may create and play their own custom levels based on Super Mario Bros., Super Mario Bros. 3, Super Mario World and New Super Mario Bros. U, and share them online. Over time, new editing tools are unlocked, allowing players to download and play levels designed by other players.
			<br />
			<br />
			Super Mario Maker received critical acclaim upon its release, with reviewers praising the game's user interface and level editing tools. In May 2016, Nintendo announced that over 7.2 million courses had been created worldwide, which had been played over 600 million times."
