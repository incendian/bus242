			"Halo 5: Guardians is a first-person shooter video game developed by 343 Industries and published by Microsoft Studios for the Xbox One home video game console. Part of the Halo series, the game was released on October 27, 2015. Halo 5's plot follows two fireteams of human supersoldiers; when Blue Team, led by Master Chief, goes absent without leave to track down the artificial intelligence construct Cortana, the Master Chief's loyalties are called into question and Spartan Locke along with Fireteam Osiris are sent to retrieve him.

			343 Industries started to formulate concepts and objectives for Halo 5 shortly after the release of its predecessor. In late 2012, the team set out goals for the game, including larger campaign and multiplayer areas. Microsoft announced Halo 5 for the Xbox One at Electronic Entertainment Expo 2013. Halo 5 features a game engine that dynamically scales its resolution in order to maintain a frame rate of 60 frames per second.

			<br />
			Upon release, Halo 5: Guardians received positive reviews from critics, with praise being directed at its gameplay, visuals, level design and multiplayer modes. The game's single-player campaign was met with divided responses, with criticism directed at its length and writing. A commercial success, Halo 5: Guardians and its game-related hardware grossed over US$400 million in its first twenty-four hours and US$500 million in its first week."
