			"Star Wars Battlefront is an action shooter video game developed by EA DICE, with additional work from Criterion Games, and published by Electronic Arts. The game, based on the Star Wars franchise, is the third major release in the Star Wars: Battlefront sub-series, and is considered a reboot to the previous games, instead of a sequel. The game was released worldwide in November 2015, and received mixed reviews from critics. Critics praised the game for its gameplay, visuals and high production values but was criticized for its lack of content on both single player and multiplayer modes. Despite this, it was a commercial success, selling over 13 million copies."
