			"Doom (stylized as DOOM) is a science fiction first-person shooter video game developed by id Software and published by Bethesda Softworks. A reboot of the Doom series, it is the fourth title in the main series and the first major installment therein since the release of Doom 3 in 2004. The game was released worldwide on Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One on May 13, 2016. The game is powered by id Tech 6.
			<br />
			<br />
			The game is played entirely from a first-person perspective, with players' taking the role of an unnamed marine, as he battles demonic forces from Hell that have been unleashed by the Union Aerospace Corporation on a future-set colonized planet Mars. The gameplay returns to a faster pace with more open-ended levels, closer to the first two games rather than the slower survival horror approach taken by Doom 3. It also features environment traversal, character upgrades, and the ability to perform executions on enemies known as "glory kills". The game also supports an online multiplayer component and a level editor known as "SnapMap", both co-developed with id Software by Certain Affinity and Escalation Studios respectively.
			<br />
			<br />
			Originally announced as under development as Doom 4 in 2008, the game underwent an extensive development cycle with different builds and designs before being restarted in 2011 and revealed as just Doom in 2014. The old version of the game was described as "Call of Doom", while the new version was inspired by rock and roll. The game was tested by both people who pre-ordered another Bethesda game, Wolfenstein: The New Order, and the general public. Mick Gordon composed the music for the game.
			<br />
			<br />
			Despite receiving negative criticism during the beta period, Doom was very well received by critics and players; the single-player campaign, graphics, and gameplay were praised, whereas the multiplayer mode drew the most criticism. The game was ranked as the second best-selling video game in the UK and the US on its first week and month respectively and sold 500,000 copies for PCs at the end of May 2016."
