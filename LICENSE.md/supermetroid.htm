			"Super Metroid is an action-adventure video game published by Nintendo, developed by its Research & Development 1 (R&D1) division, and programmed by Intelligent Systems for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. It was released in Japan on March 19, 1994, in North America on April 18, and in Europe and Australia on July 28. The game was directed and written by Yoshio Sakamoto, and produced by Makoto Kano, with Gunpei Yokoi serving as general manager. It is the third game in the Metroid series.

			Super Metroid is a direct sequel to Metroid II: Return of Samus (1991). The player controls bounty hunter Samus Aran as she attempts to retrieve a Metroid larva stolen by the Space Pirate leader Ridley. The gameplay focuses on exploration, with the player searching for power-ups that are used to reach previously inaccessible areas. It introduces new concepts to the series, such as the inventory screen, an automapping facility, and the ability to fire in all directions.

			Super Metroid received critical acclaim, and is widely considered by many critics and gamers to be one of the greatest video games of all time, owing to its use of atmosphere, gameplay, audio, cinematic elements and graphics. While the game sold poorly in Japan, it fared better in North America and Europe. Super Metroid became popular among players for speedrunning, and its gameplay and design influenced other games, including Shadow Complex and Axiom Verge. The game was followed by the 2002 release of Metroid Fusion and Metroid Prime, ending the series' eight-year hiatus. Since 2007, Super Metroid has been released for the Virtual Console service on the Wii, the Wii U, and the New Nintendo 3DS."
